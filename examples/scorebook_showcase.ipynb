    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Trismik's ScoreBook library to evaluate large language models. Scorebook is a library that allows you to evaluate LLMs with any dataset from Hugging Face or your own, and calculate scores for metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1. ScoreBook facilitates intuitive and efficient LLM experimentation with features such as grouping evaluations, batch inferencing, and sweeping across a grid of hyperparameter configurations."

    "- Built on top of HuggingFace datasets for compatibility\n",

    "\n",
    "The `InferencePipeline` is ScoreBook's modular approach to model inference. It separates the inference process into three distinct, customizable stages, making it easy to work with different models and data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipeline Stages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-processor**: Converts dataset items into the format expected by your model\n",
    "2. **Inference Function**: Performs the actual model inference (can be sync or async)\n",
    "3. **Post-processor**: Extracts the final prediction from the model's raw output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-processor**\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessor function within an inference pipeline, converts each item within an evaluation dataset, into the format expected by the module used. This may include transformations such as combining dataset fields, adding context, and formatting messages within a message dict structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a pre-processor function, it must accept a single evaluation dataset item as a parameter, and return an output that can be passed into a model\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Pre-Processor Function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def preprocessor(eval_item: dict) -> list:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Convert evaluation item to model input format.\"\"\"\n",

    "                Answer the question you are given using only a single letter (for example, 'A').\n",

    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics in ScoreBook quantify how well your model performs by comparing predictions against ground truth labels. The framework provides built-in metrics and supports custom metric creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Built-in Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from scorebook.metrics import Accuracy\n",
    "   metric = Accuracy()\n",
    "   aggregate_scores, item_scores = metric.score(outputs, labels)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from scorebook.metrics import Precision\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metric Architecture:**\n",
    "- All metrics inherit from `MetricBase` abstract class\n",
    "- Implement a `score()` method that returns both aggregate and per-item scores\n",
    "- Automatically registered via `@MetricRegistry.register()` decorator\n",
    "- Can be referenced by string name or class directly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Metrics:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from scorebook.metrics import MetricBase, MetricRegistry\n",
    "\n",
    "@MetricRegistry.register()\n",
    "class CustomF1Score(MetricBase):\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def score(outputs, labels):\n",
    "        # Calculate F1 score logic here\n",
    "        item_scores = [calculate_f1(out, lab) for out, lab in zip(outputs, labels)]\n",
    "        aggregate_score = {\"f1\": sum(item_scores) / len(item_scores)}\n",
    "        return aggregate_score, item_scores\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Patterns:**\n",
    "- Specify metrics when creating datasets: `metrics=[\"accuracy\", \"precision\"]`\n",
    "- Mix built-in and custom metrics: `metrics=[Accuracy, CustomF1Score]`\n",
    "- Access via registry: `MetricRegistry.get(\"accuracy\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each metric returns both aggregate scores (summary statistics) and item-level scores (individual predictions) for detailed analysis."

It handles the entire evaluation workflow automatically.\n\n**Core Functionality:**\n\n```python\nfrom scorebook import evaluate\n\nresults = evaluate(\n    inference_pipeline,    # Your inference pipeline\n    eval_datasets,        # Single dataset or list of datasets  \n    hyperparameters=None, # Optional parameter sweep\n    item_limit=None,      # Limit evaluation to N items\n    score_type=\"aggregate\", # \"aggregate\", \"item\", or \"all\"\n    return_type=\"dict\"    # Format of returned results\n)\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n1. **Multi-Dataset Support**: Evaluate on multiple datasets in one call\n   ```python\n   datasets = [mmlu_dataset, hellaswag_dataset, arc_dataset]\n   results = evaluate(pipeline, datasets)\n   ```\n\n2. **Hyperparameter Sweeping**: Test different model configurations\n   ```python\n   hyperparams = {\n       \"temperature\": [0.7, 0.9],\n       \"max_tokens\": [50, 100],\n       \"top_p\": [0.9, 0.95]\n   }\n   results = evaluate(pipeline, dataset, hyperparameters=hyperparams)\n   ```\n\n3. **Flexible Scoring**: Choose what level of detail you need\n   - `\"aggregate\"`: Overall dataset scores only\n   - `\"item\"`: Individual prediction scores only  \n   - `\"all\"`: Both aggregate and per-item scores\n\n4. **Progress Tracking**: Built-in progress bars for long evaluations\n\n5. **Async Support**: Handles both synchronous and asynchronous inference functions\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Normalizes input datasets and expands hyperparameter grids\n2. For each dataset × hyperparameter combination:\n   - Preprocesses items using the pipeline\n   - Runs model inference \n   - Postprocesses outputs\n   - Computes metric scores\n3. Formats and returns results according to specified parameters\n\nThe function returns structured results that can be easily analyzed, saved, or visualized.",

Run evaluation to get `EvalResult` objects\n2. Access aggregate scores for high-level performance overview  \n3. Drill into item scores to understand model behavior on specific examples\n4.
