Find the characteristic of the ring 2Z.","['0', '30', '3', '10', '12', '50', '2', '100', '20', '5']",A,0,A: Let's think step by step. A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ for some $k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. The answer is (A).,math,cot_lib-abstract_algebra,G,False
1,1,"Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))).

For a given polynomial $p$ we have
\[ST(p) = (xp(x))’ = p(x) + xp’(x)\]

2,2,"Let A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \in A}?","['-5', '0', '-3', '-7', '-4', '-6', '-1', '-2', '-9', 'N/A']",E,4,"A: Let's think step by step. We have 12n = 22 - 7m and one of the solutions is $m = -2$, $n = 3$. Then $m + n = 1$, hence we need to look for smaller $m$ in order to make $m + n$ negative. The next solution is $m = -14$ and $n = 10$. For smaller $m$ we have $m + n$ smaller than $-4$. The answer is (E).",math,cot_lib-college_mathematics,A,False
3,3,"A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?","['3 + e^-2', '2 - e^-4', '2 - e^-2', '3 + e^-4', '2 + e^-3', '2 - e^-3', '3 - e^-2', '2 + e^-2', '2 + e^-4', '2']",I,8,"A: Let's think step by step. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, let $s(t)$ denote the number grams of salt in the tank at the $t$ minute mark. Then $s(0) = 3$.
We use $s$ and $s(t)$ interchangeably. We also use $s^{\prime}$ and $s^{\prime}(t)$ interchangeably. The solution sprayed into the tank adds $(0.02) 4=2 / 25$ grams of salt per minute. There are always 100 liters of liquid in the tank, containing $s$ grams of salt. So the density of salt in the tank is $s / 100$ grams per liter. The flow of water out of the tank therefore subtracts $4(s / 100)=s / 25$ grams of salt per minute. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $s^{\prime}(t)=(2 / 25)-(s / 25)=(2-s) / 25$, and so $[s(t)=2] \Rightarrow\left[s^{\prime}(t)=0ight]$. For all $t \in \mathbb{R}$,
$$
\frac{d}{d t}[\ln (s-2)]=\frac{s^{\prime}}{s-2}=\frac{-1}{25}=\frac{d}{d t}\left[-\frac{t}{25}ight] .
$$
Choose $C \in \mathbb{R}$ such that, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}, \ln ((s(t)-2))=-[t / 25]+C$. Let $K:=e^{C}$. Then, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$, we have $(s(t))-2=K e^{-t / 25}$, and so $s(t)=2+K e^{-t / 25}$. Then $3=s(0)=2+K e^{0}=2+K$, so $K=1$. Then $s(100)=2+K e^{-100 / 25}=2+1 \cdot e^{-4}=2+e^{-4}$.

4,4,A total of 30 players will play basketball at a park. There will be exactly 5 players on each team. Which statement correctly explains how to find the number of teams needed?,"['Multiply 5 by 5 to find 25 teams.', 'Divide 30 by 5 to find 6 teams.', 'Add 5 to 30 to find 35 teams.', 'Subtract 30 from 5 to find -25 teams.', 'Divide 5 by 30 to find 0.1667 teams.', 'Add 5 to 30 then divide by 2 to find 17.5 teams.', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'N/A']",B,1,"A: Let's think step by step. We want to find the number of teams. We know that there are 5 players/team, and 30 players. Thus to get the number of teams we divide players by players/team, so 30 players / 5 players/team = 6 teams. The answer is (B).",math,cot_lib-elementary_mathematics,B,True

In its resting position, it lies between the ase of the mandible and the third cervical vertebrae. We know that the second and the third pharyngeal arches give rise to the horns of the hyoid bone; therefore, the embryological origin of the hyoid bone are the second and the third pharyngeal arches—this information is covered in option (G).
