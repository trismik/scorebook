    "## What is Adaptive Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Trismik’s adaptive testing service leverages item response theory (IRT), a psychometric framework, to evaluate large language models. Using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) it dynamically selects the most informative items, enabling faster, more cost-efficient model evaluations with fewer items required.\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate a Trismik API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "To run an adaptive evaluation, a Trismik API key is required. You can [sign up](https://dashboard.trismik.com/signup) for a free Trismik account and generate an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to generate an API key from the Trismik dashboard**:\n",
    "1. click on your initials in the top-right corner of the screen.\n",
    "2. click on \"API Keys\" in the drop-down menu.\n",
    "3. click \"Create API Key\" to create a new API key."
