    "\n",
    "Trismik’s adaptive testing service leverages item response theory (IRT), a psychometric framework, to evaluate large language models. Using computerized adaptive testing (CAT) it dynamically selects the most informative items, enabling faster, more cost-efficient model evaluations with fewer items required.\n",
