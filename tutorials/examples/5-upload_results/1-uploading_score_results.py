    """Score pre-computed outputs and upload results to Trismik's dashboard.

    This example demonstrates how to upload score() results to Trismik.
    The score() function is used when you already have model outputs and
    want to score them against labels.

    Use score() when you want to:
        - Score pre-computed model outputs
        - Re-score existing results with different metrics
        - Upload scoring results without re-running inference

    Prerequisites:
        - Valid Trismik API key set in TRISMIK_API_KEY environment variable
        - A Trismik project ID
